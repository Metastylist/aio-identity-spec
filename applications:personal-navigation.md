# Personal Navigation: Identity Work Protocols

**Navigation begins with knowing where you are.**

---

## Overview

Personal Navigation translates Metastyling theory into operational practice—protocols for mapping current configuration, identifying accessible Faces, forecasting probable trajectories, and navigating intentionally toward chosen futures.

**This is not therapy**—it is field cartography. The framework provides maps and tools. You navigate.

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ Understanding of [DMES Vectors](../core-concepts/02-dmes-vectors.md)
- ✅ Understanding of [Faces](../core-concepts/03-faces-attractors.md)
- ✅ Understanding of [LoA](../core-concepts/04-levels-of-awareness.md)

**Time investment**: Initial mapping (2-4 hours), ongoing observation (10-15 min/day)

---

## Protocol 1: Current Configuration Assessment

**Goal**: Establish baseline—where are you now?

### Step 1: DMES Self-Assessment

Rate yourself **right now** on each vector (0-10 scale):

**Direction (D)** — Motivational orientation
```
0 = Entirely reactive (validation-driven, no autonomous direction)
5 = Mixed (some clarity, but context-dependent)
10 = Fully autonomous (internally generated, consistent across contexts)

Current D: _____ / 10
```

**Meaning (M)** — Interpretive flexibility
```
0 = Threat-locked (single interpretation, everything filtered through danger/inadequacy)
5 = Dominant frame (one primary lens, some flexibility)
10 = Multi-lens (flexible interpretation, context-appropriate)

Current M: _____ / 10
```

**Expression (E)** — Outward congruence
```
0 = Collapsed or over-controlled (internal state ≠ external signal)
5 = Managed (functional presentation, some performance strain)
10 = Fully congruent (internal state = external signal, no performance gap)

Current E: _____ / 10
```

**State (S)** — Nervous system regulation
```
0 = Dysregulated (hyperarousal or shutdown, no prefrontal access)
5 = Moderate (manageable under low stress, destabilizes under pressure)
10 = Fully regulated (tolerates discomfort, returns to baseline quickly)

Current S: _____ / 10
```

**Current DMES**: `[D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]`

---

### Step 2: Face Identification

**Question**: Which Face is currently active?

Review common Face archetypes (or create your own names):
- **Strategist**: Analytical, planning-oriented, calm under complexity
- **Critic**: Evaluative, finds flaws, defensive/protective
- **Visionary**: Future-oriented, big-picture, inspiring
- **Architect**: Systems-building, designing structures
- **Caretaker**: Supportive, relationship-focused, nurturing
- **Performer**: Social, charismatic, externally-focused
- **Wounded Child**: Defensive, shame-based, reactive to perceived threat
- **Explorer**: Curious, experimental, novelty-seeking

**Current Face**: _________________

**Secondary Faces** (if blended): _________________

---

### Step 3: Context Mapping

**Question**: When does this Face typically activate?

| Context | Face Activated | DMES Signature |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Work (high-stakes) | | [D:__, M:__, E:__, S:__] |
| Work (routine) | | |
| Social (close friends) | | |
| Social (new people) | | |
| Conflict/criticism | | |
| Creative work | | |
| Alone/reflection | | |

**Pattern recognition**: Which Face is your **default** (activates most frequently)?

---

## Protocol 2: Face Repertoire Mapping

**Goal**: Identify all accessible Faces (your identity landscape)

### Step 1: Historical Face Inventory

**Instructions**: List all distinct configurations you've occupied in past 6 months

For each Face, document:
1. **Name** (what you call this configuration)
2. **DMES signature** (characteristic [D, M, E, S] values)
3. **Activation frequency** (% of time)
4. **Typical contexts** (when/where it appears)
5. **Attractor depth** (how stable—easy to enter/exit?)

**Example**:
```
Face: Strategist
DMES: [D:7, M:7, E:6, S:7]
Frequency: 40%
Contexts: Work planning, problem-solving, project management
Depth: Deep (automatically activates in work contexts, stable under pressure)
```

**Your Face Repertoire** (list 5-12):

1. _________________
2. _________________
3. _________________
[...]

---

### Step 2: Attractor Classification

Classify each Face:

**Core Faces** (deep, frequent):
- Easy to access
- Stable once activated
- Hard to exit (even when context shifts)

**Situational Faces** (moderate):
- Context-dependent
- Moderately stable
- Flexible entry/exit

**Dormant Faces** (shallow, rare):
- Hard to access (requires specific conditions)
- Unstable (collapses under pressure)
- Glimpsed but not sustained

**Defensive Faces** (trauma-activated):
- Activate automatically under threat
- Very deep attractor (childhood grooves)
- Hard to exit even after threat passes

---

## Protocol 3: Baseline Trajectory Forecast

**Goal**: Where is the field naturally flowing (if nothing changes)?

### Step 1: Pattern Recognition

Review past 3-6 months:
- Which Face(s) are **deepening** (activating more frequently)?
- Which are **shallowing** (becoming less accessible)?
- Which DMES vectors are **drifting** (D/M/E/S changing over time)?

**Trends**:
- Face increasing: _________________
- Face declining: _________________
- DMES drift: D (↑/↓/→), M (↑/↓/→), E (↑/↓/→), S (↑/↓/→)

---

### Step 2: Baseline Forecast (3-6 months forward)

**If current trajectory continues**, predict:

**Most probable configuration** (60-70% confidence):
- Dominant Face: _________________
- DMES: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]

**Alternative outcomes** (20-30%):
- Face: _________________
- DMES: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]

**Risk zone** (5-15%):
- What could trigger collapse/bifurcation? _________________
- Early-warning signs: _________________

---

## Protocol 4: Desired Configuration (Target State)

**Goal**: Where do you want to navigate?

### Step 1: Vision Clarity

**Question**: If you could occupy any configuration, what would it be?

**Target Face**: _________________

**Target DMES**: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]

**Behavioral markers** (how you'd know you're there):
1. _________________
2. _________________
3. _________________

---

### Step 2: Alignment Check (Organic vs Imposed)

**Critical question**: Does this target emerge from your field, or is it externally suggested?

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where did this goal originate? (Internal observation vs external pressure) | |
| When you imagine being there, does it feel like **flow** or **force**? | |
| If you stopped pushing, would you naturally move toward this or away? | |
| Is this **your** vision or someone else's expectation? | |

**If mostly external** → High α (imposed) → Reconsider target or redesign to align with field

**If mostly internal** → Low α (organic) → Proceed with navigation planning

---

## Protocol 5: Navigation Planning

**Goal**: Design pathway from current → target

### Step 1: Calculate Distance & Cost

**DMES distance**:
$$d = \sqrt{(D_2-D_1)^2 + (M_2-M_1)^2 + (E_2-E_1)^2 + (S_2-S_1)^2}$$

**Current**: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]  
**Target**: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]  
**Distance**: _____ units

**Cost estimate** (use [Cost Function](../formulas/cost-function.md)):
- If organic (α ≈ 0): Cost ≈ k × d × β
- If imposed (α ≫ 1): Cost may be exponential (reconsider)

**Estimated cost**: _____ tokens

---

### Step 2: Resource Assessment

**Current resource capacity**:
- State stability: S = _____ (if S < 4.0, stabilize first)
- Context support: Low / Moderate / High
- LoA baseline: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3

**Available R(t)**: _____ tokens/week

**Timeline** (Time = Cost / R):
$$\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{R(t)} = \frac{_____}{_____} = _____ \text{ weeks}$$

**Feasible?**
- ✅ Yes (R > R_min, timeline reasonable)
- ⚠️ Borderline (R ≈ R_min, long timeline)
- ❌ No (R < R_min or timeline > window of opportunity)

---

### Step 3: Phased Navigation (if direct transition too costly)

**Strategy**: Identify intermediate Face as stepping stone

**Current** → **Intermediate** → **Target**

**Example**:
- Current: Critic [D:4, M:3, E:6, S:5]
- Intermediate: Strategist [D:6, M:6, E:6, S:6] ← closer, easier
- Target: Architect [D:8, M:8, E:8, S:7]

**Phase 1** (Current → Intermediate): 12 weeks, 400 tokens  
**Phase 2** (Intermediate → Target): 16 weeks, 600 tokens  
**Total**: 28 weeks, 1000 tokens (vs direct: infeasible)

---

## Protocol 6: Daily Observation Practice

**Goal**: Build LoA 0→1→2 through consistent self-seeing

### LoA 0→1: Pattern Naming (10 min/day)

**After significant events**, write:
1. What happened? (external event)
2. What Face activated? (name without judgment)
3. What was DMES configuration? [D:__, M:__, E:__, S:__]
4. What triggered the shift? (context, stimulus)

**No analysis needed**—just name and document.

**Timeline**: 2-3 months of daily practice builds LoA 1 baseline

---

### LoA 1→2: Bifurcation Awareness (ongoing)

**Before high-stakes situations**:
1. Notice automatic Face activation starting ("Critic pulling")
2. Pause—create micro-gap (3 breaths)
3. Ask: "Could I activate different Face here?"
4. Choose: "I'll go in as Strategist instead"
5. Embody: Posture, breath, internal frame shift

**Practice in low-stakes contexts first**, build skill, then apply in higher-stakes situations.

**Timeline**: 3-6 months of practice enables real-time Face selection (LoA 2)

---

## Protocol 7: Progress Tracking

**Weekly check-in** (5 min):

1. **Dominant Face this week**: _________________
2. **DMES average**: [D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]
3. **Trajectory**: Moving toward target / Stable / Drifting away
4. **Challenges**: _________________
5. **Adjustments needed**: _________________

**Monthly review** (30 min):
- Compare current DMES to baseline (4 weeks ago)
- Assess Face activation frequencies (shifting as intended?)
- Recalculate Cost/Time if trajectory not as forecasted
- Adjust navigation plan if needed

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Attempting LoA 2 navigation at LoA 0
**Symptom**: "I know what to do but can't do it"  
**Fix**: Build LoA 1 first (pattern naming, no judgment, consistency)

### 2. Forcing imposed transitions
**Symptom**: Constant effort, no progress, feels exhausting  
**Fix**: Check alignment—if α high, redesign target to match field

### 3. Ignoring State thresholds
**Symptom**: Plan looks good but keeps collapsing  
**Fix**: Stabilize S first (somatic work), then attempt modulation

### 4. Impatience (rushing)
**Symptom**: Push hard → burnout → reversion  
**Fix**: Sustainable pace (R < capacity, allow recovery)

---

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Metastyling is compatible with**:
- Somatic practices (for S stabilization)
- Strategic planning tools (for D clarity)
- Narrative work (for M reframe)
- Any body-based or systems-oriented approach

**Metastyling is NOT**:
- Replacement for trauma therapy (if clinical pathology present)
- Magic solution (still requires sustained practice)
- Personality typing (dynamic field, not fixed categories)
