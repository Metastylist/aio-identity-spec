# AI Character Design: Dynamic NPCs & Narrative Agents

**Characters are not scripts—they are identity fields that respond to context.**

---

## Overview

Metastyling provides architecture for **dynamic character AI**—designing NPCs (non-player characters), narrative agents, and interactive personas as identity fields rather than finite-state machines.

**Traditional character AI**:
- Scripted dialogue trees
- Fixed personality traits
- Deterministic responses
- Binary emotional states

**Metastyling character AI**:
- DMES-based state space
- Multiple Faces (context-dependent configurations)
- Dynamic attractor landscape
- Emergent behavior from field dynamics

**Applications**:
- Video game NPCs (context-responsive, memorable)
- Interactive narratives (adaptive storytelling)
- Virtual companions (consistent yet dynamic)
- Training simulations (realistic human behavior)
- Brand personas (coherent multi-channel presence)

**This is not about making AI "more human"**—it's about making character behavior **structurally coherent** across contexts.

---

## Character as Identity Field

### Core Principle

**A character is defined by**:
1. **DMES signature** (base configuration)
2. **Face repertoire** (5-8 stable configurations)
3. **Attractor landscape** (which Faces activate under what conditions)
4. **Transition dynamics** (how character moves between Faces)

**Not defined by**: Personality labels, trait scores, static backstory

---

### Example: Character "Elena" (Shopkeeper)

**Base DMES** (neutral/greeting context):
```
D: 6.5 (helpful, not overly invested)
M: 7.0 (pragmatic, transactional)
E: 7.5 (friendly, professional)
S: 7.0 (calm, stable)
```

**Face Repertoire**:

| Face | DMES | Activation Context | Behavior |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Friendly Merchant** | [D:6.5, M:7, E:7.5, S:7] | Regular customer, routine transaction | Warm greeting, small talk, efficient service |
| **Cautious Trader** | [D:5, M:6, E:6, S:6] | First-time customer, expensive item | Polite but reserved, assesses trustworthiness |
| **Protective Elder** | [D:8, M:8, E:8, S:7.5] | Player in danger, quest-related advice | Direct warning, personal investment, mentor tone |
| **Wounded Survivor** | [D:3, M:4, E:4, S:3] | Shop attacked, loved one threatened | Fearful, fragmented speech, withdrawn |
| **Grieving Friend** | [D:4, M:5, E:5, S:4.5] | NPC death mentioned, memorial context | Subdued, reflective, emotional vulnerability |

**Character depth emerges from Face transitions**—not from more dialogue, but from **coherent reconfiguration** in response to context.

---

## Design Protocol

### Step 1: Define Character's Identity Field

**1.1 Establish Base DMES**

**Direction (D)**: What drives this character?
```
Examples:
- Quest-giver NPC: D:8 (mission-oriented, strong sense of purpose)
- Tavern drunk: D:2 (aimless, reactive to environment)
- Rebel leader: D:9 (autonomous, ideologically driven)
```

**Meaning (M)**: How does character interpret events?
```
Examples:
- Optimist: M:8 (sees opportunities, reframes setbacks)
- Paranoid: M:3 (threat-focused, zero-sum)
- Pragmatist: M:7 (data-driven, flexible interpretation)
```

**Expression (E)**: How does character communicate?
```
Examples:
- Charismatic leader: E:9 (compelling, congruent)
- Shy scholar: E:4 (withdrawn, internal ≠ external)
- Smooth diplomat: E:8 (polished, calibrated)
```

**State (S)**: Character's nervous system baseline
```
Examples:
- War veteran: S:5 (hypervigilant, easily triggered)
- Monk: S:9 (deeply regulated, unflappable)
- Young soldier: S:6 (competent but destabilizes under pressure)
```

**Character's base DMES**: `[D:___, M:___, E:___, S:___]`

---

### Step 2: Design Face Repertoire

**How many Faces?**
- **Simple NPC**: 3-4 Faces (shopkeeper, quest-giver, background character)
- **Supporting character**: 5-6 Faces (recurring interactions, some depth)
- **Main character**: 7-10 Faces (complex arc, memorable)

**For each Face, specify**:

1. **Name** (internal identifier)
2. **DMES signature** (what makes this Face distinct)
3. **Activation triggers** (context, player actions, game state)
4. **Behavioral markers** (dialogue tone, body language, decision patterns)
5. **Attractor depth** (how stable—easy to enter/exit?)

**Example template**:
```yaml
face:
  name: "Protective Elder"
  dmes: [D:8, M:8, E:8, S:7.5]
  triggers:
    - player_health < 30%
    - quest_difficulty_high: true
    - relationship_trust > 60
  behaviors:
    - dialogue_tone: "direct_warning"
    - body_language: "concerned_lean_forward"
    - offers_help: true
  attractor_depth: "moderate" # activates in protective contexts, stable while active
```

---

### Step 3: Define Transition Dynamics

**Question**: How does character move between Faces?

**Transition triggers**:

| Trigger Type | Example | Face Transition |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Context shift** | Safe town → dangerous dungeon | Friendly Merchant → Cautious Survivor |
| **Player action** | Betray trust, help in crisis | Ally → Wounded Betrayed |
| **Time passage** | After major event (grieving period) | Grieving Friend → Weary Acceptance |
| **Relationship threshold** | Trust > 80 | Professional → Personal Confidant |
| **State destabilization** | S drops below 4.0 (under attack) | Any Face → Defensive/Panicked |

**Transition cost**:
- **Low-cost** (organic): Friendly → Cautious (same character, different context)
- **High-cost** (imposed): Wounded → Heroic (requires major event, unstable)

**Design principle**: Make transitions **coherent but not instantaneous**—character should show transition signatures (hesitation, micro-expressions, partial Face blending).

---

### Step 4: Implement Attractor Landscape

**Character's attractor landscape = which Faces are deep/shallow**

**Deep attractors** (character defaults to these):
- Appear frequently across contexts
- Stable once activated
- Hard to pull character out of (even when context shifts)

**Shallow attractors** (situational, unstable):
- Require specific triggers
- Collapse quickly when context changes
- May be glimpsed but not sustained

**Example: Haunted Veteran NPC**
```
Deep attractors:
  - Hypervigilant Survivor (S:4, default under any stress)
  - Weary Protector (when protecting others)

Shallow attractors:
  - Peaceful Moment (S:7, only when safe + trusted companion + no triggers)
  - Joyful Remembrance (reminiscing about past, fragile)

Defensive attractors (trauma-activated):
  - Dissociated Shutdown (S:1, when reminded of traumatic event)
```

**Gameplay implication**: Player actions can deepen or shallow attractors over time
- Repeated safe interactions → Peaceful Moment becomes more accessible
- Trigger traumatic reminders → Dissociated Shutdown deepens

**This creates emergent relationship dynamics**—not scripted, but structurally coherent.

---

## Advanced Features

### Feature 1: Player as Resonance Stimulus

**Player's actions = external patterns that match/mismatch character's internal frequencies**

**Resonance occurs when**:
- Player's behavior matches character's dormant Face
- Activates that Face effortlessly (no deliberate transition needed)

**Example**:
```
Character: Elena (shopkeeper)
Dormant Face: "Protective Elder" (rarely activates)

Player action: Defends shop during raid (resonates with protective instinct)
  ↓
Protective Elder activates strongly
  ↓
Elena now treats player as family (relationship shift)
  ↓
New dialogue/quests unlock (emergent, not pre-scripted)
```

**Implementation**: Track player action patterns, match to character Face frequencies, amplify when resonance detected.

---

### Feature 2: Character Arc as Attractor Evolution

**Traditional character arcs**: Scripted personality change

**Metastyling character arcs**: Attractor landscape modification over time

**Example: Redemption Arc**
```
Act 1: Cynical Mercenary (deep attractor)
  DMES: [D:4, M:3, E:6, S:6]
  Default Face: "Self-Interested Operator"

Act 2: Crisis forces confrontation
  Player actions + major event → S destabilization
  New Face glimpsed: "Reluctant Hero" (shallow, unstable)

Act 3: Repeated activation deepens new attractor
  Multiple choices aligned with heroic Face
  "Reluctant Hero" becomes moderate attractor
  "Cynical Mercenary" becomes shallow

Act 4: Transformation complete
  "Committed Protector" is now deep attractor
  DMES shifted: [D:7, M:7, E:7, S:7]
  Old Face still accessible (under extreme stress) but no longer default
```

**Key difference from script**: Transformation is **gradual attractor shift**, not discrete personality flip.

---

### Feature 3: Multi-Agent Field Coupling

**When multiple NPCs interact**, their fields couple—influencing each other's configurations.

**Example: Town Council Scene**
```
NPC 1 (Mayor): D:7, M:7, E:8, S:7 (calm, diplomatic)
NPC 2 (Guard Captain): D:8, M:5, E:6, S:5 (action-oriented, tense)
NPC 3 (Merchant): D:6, M:6, E:7, S:4 (anxious about trade)

Coupling dynamics:
  - Mayor's high S stabilizes group (co-regulation)
  - Guard Captain's low M (threat-focused) pulls Mayor toward defensive framing
  - Merchant's low S creates contagion risk (if anxiety spreads, collective S drops)

Player enters → additional field coupling
  - Player's high D + high S → Mayor aligns (strategic partnership Face activates)
  - Guard Captain feels player as threat (M:5 threat-lock) → oppositional Face
  - Merchant reads room tension → anxiety increases (S drops further)

Emergent outcome: Mayor + Player alliance, Guard Captain suspicious, Merchant panics
  → Not scripted, but structurally determined by field coupling
```

**Implementation**: NPCs influence each other's S (co-regulation), M (shared narrative), and Face activation probabilities.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Structure (per character)
```json
{
  "character_id": "elena_shopkeeper",
  "base_dmes": {"D": 6.5, "M": 7.0, "E": 7.5, "S": 7.0},
  "current_dmes": {"D": 6.5, "M": 7.0, "E": 7.5, "S": 7.0},
  "faces": [
    {
      "id": "friendly_merchant",
      "dmes": {"D": 6.5, "M": 7, "E": 7.5, "S": 7},
      "weight": 0.7,
      "depth": "deep",
      "triggers": ["context:shop", "player_relationship:neutral"]
    },
    {
      "id": "protective_elder",
      "dmes": {"D": 8, "M": 8, "E": 8, "S": 7.5},
      "weight": 0.2,
      "depth": "moderate",
      "triggers": ["player_health<30", "trust>60"]
    }
  ],
  "state_history": [],
  "relationship_scores": {"player": 45, "town_guard": 70}
}
```

---

### Real-Time Face Activation

**Each game tick**:
1. **Evaluate context**: Extract current game state (location, threat level, NPCs present, player actions)
2. **Calculate match scores**: For each Face, compute `match(Face, context, player_actions)`
3. **Update weights**: $\dot{w}_k = \alpha_k(\text{match}_k - w_k) + u_k$ (from Master Equation)
4. **Select dominant Face**: Face with highest weight becomes active configuration
5. **Generate behavior**: Map Face → dialogue options, animations, decision logic

**Smooth transitions**: Blend between Faces over 2-3 seconds (not instant flip).

---

### Player Impact on Character Evolution

**Track player actions** → **modify attractor landscape over time**:
```python
# Pseudo-code
if player_action == "defend_npc":
    character.deepen_face("protective_elder", amount=0.05)
    character.shallow_face("cynical_merchant", amount=0.03)

if player_action == "betray_trust":
    character.deepen_face("wounded_betrayed", amount=0.15)
    character.relationship_score["player"] -= 20
```

**Over multiple interactions**: Character's default Face shifts based on accumulated player influence.

---

## Use Cases Beyond Gaming

### 1. Interactive Storytelling

**Characters in branching narratives**:
- DMES state determines dialogue tone/content
- Face transitions create organic plot developments
- Reader choices = resonance stimuli activating different character Faces

---

### 2. Virtual Companions / Chatbots

**Consistency + adaptability**:
- Base DMES ensures recognizable personality
- Face repertoire allows context-appropriate responses
- Avoids uncanny valley of "always cheerful" or "always formal"

**Example**: Customer service AI
- Professional Face (default)
- Empathetic Face (customer distressed)
- Firm Boundary Face (customer abusive)

---

### 3. Brand Personas

**Coherent multi-channel presence**:
- Same brand, different Faces across contexts (Twitter vs LinkedIn vs customer support)
- DMES signature maintains recognizability
- Face transitions feel organic, not schizophrenic

---

### 4. Training Simulations

**Realistic human behavior modeling**:
- Medical simulations (patients with trauma responses)
- Crisis negotiation training (subjects with dynamic emotional states)
- Leadership development (team members with varying configurations)

**Key**: Characters respond structurally (not from script), creating unpredictable-but-coherent challenges.

---

## Advantages Over Traditional Character AI

| Traditional AI | Metastyling AI |
|----------------|----------------|
| Fixed personality traits | Dynamic DMES state space |
| Scripted responses | Emergent behavior from field dynamics |
| Binary emotional states | Continuous S regulation with thresholds |
| Dialogue trees | Face-based behavioral generation |
| Static relationships | Evolving attractor landscape |
| Predictable after first encounter | Surprising yet coherent across contexts |

**Player experience**: Characters feel **alive**—not because they're unpredictable, but because they're **structurally coherent** across contexts.

## Design Checklist

**For each character, ensure**:
- ✅ Base DMES defined (what is default configuration?)
- ✅ 3-8 Faces specified (repertoire matches narrative importance)
- ✅ Triggers documented (when does each Face activate?)
- ✅ Attractor depths assigned (which Faces are deep vs shallow?)
- ✅ Transition dynamics designed (how character moves between Faces)
- ✅ Player influence modeled (how actions shift landscape over time)
