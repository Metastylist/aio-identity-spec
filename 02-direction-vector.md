# Direction Vector (D): Motivational Orientation

**Direction (D) determines whether you move toward what you want, or away from what you fear.**

---

## Q: What is Direction?

**Definition**: Direction (D) is the **motivational vector** answering **"WHY?"**—the force determining whether the system moves autonomously (internally generated) or reactively (externally driven).

**In one sentence**: Direction is the source and quality of your motivation.

**Dual axes**:
- **Semantic**: Intention (pre-articulated impulse to move)
- **Environmental**: Desire (intention refracted through context, shaped by what feels possible)

---

## Scale Characteristics (0-10)

### High Direction (8-10): Autonomous

**Markers**:
- Internally generated motivation (know what you want, independent of external validation)
- Consistent across contexts (direction holds even when opposed)
- Generative orientation (move toward goals, not away from threats)
- Clear "yes" and "no" (boundaries emerge naturally from direction)

**Example**: "I want to build systems that help people navigate complexity"—this drives decisions without needing approval or reaction to circumstances.

**Autonomy signature**: D independent of context and opinion

---

### Mid Direction (4-7): Mixed

**Markers**:
- Some internal clarity, but influenced by external feedback
- Direction shifts with context (confident here, uncertain there)
- Mix of approach (toward goals) and avoidance (away from threats)
- Boundaries present but sometimes compromised under pressure

**Example**: "I want creative work, but also need stable income"—competing directions create internal negotiation.

**Mixed signature**: D partially context-dependent

---

### Low Direction (0-3): Reactive

**Markers**:
- Externally driven (motivation defined by what others want, fear of consequences, proving something)
- Direction changes with audience (perform differently for different people)
- Avoidance orientation (move away from pain, not toward vision)
- No stable boundaries (say "yes" when you mean "no")

**Example**: "I should pursue this promotion because everyone expects it"—direction generated by external pressure, not internal clarity.

**Reactive signature**: D determined by context and validation needs

---

## The Reactive → Autonomous Spectrum

Direction is not binary (reactive OR autonomous). It's a spectrum:
```
Reactive (0-3) → Mixed (4-7) → Autonomous (8-10)
```

**Key distinction**:
- **Reactive D**: Motivation generated by external forces (validation, fear, comparison)
- **Autonomous D**: Motivation generated internally (values, curiosity, vision)

**Clinical parallel**: Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)—intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation. Direction vector quantifies position on this spectrum.

## Direction in DMES System

### S → D Coupling (State determines Direction stability)

**When S drops below 4.0, D collapses to reactive:**
```
S: 7→3 (stress/threat)
  ↓
D: 7→2 (survival overrides autonomous direction)
```

**Why**: Autonomic nervous system in survival mode → no access to prefrontal cortex → no capacity for strategic, internally-driven motivation. System defaults to fight-flight-freeze.

**Recovery**: Stabilize S first → D naturally shifts from reactive to autonomous.

**Full details**: [State Vector](./02-state-vector.md)

---

### D → M (Direction shapes Meaning)

**Direction determines which stories feel relevant:**

- **Autonomous D**: "I'm building something meaningful" (generative narrative)
- **Reactive D**: "I'm proving I'm good enough" (validation-seeking narrative)

**Same external event**, different interpretations depending on D.

**Example**: Feedback received
- Autonomous D → "Useful data for iteration"
- Reactive D → "Threat to self-worth"

---

## Modulation Methods

Direction shifts through:

**1. Clarification (interrogate motivation)**
- Ask: "Am I doing this because I want it, or because I think I should?"
- Distinguish internal pull from external pressure
- Notice when "yes" feels like obligation

**2. Meaning reframe (shift from avoidance to approach)**
- Reactive: "I must avoid failure"
- Autonomous: "I want to build mastery"
- Reframe threat → opportunity

**3. State stabilization (prerequisite)**
- Cannot access autonomous D when S < 4.0
- Regulate nervous system first
- Then direction clarity becomes accessible

**4. Small experiments (test autonomous direction)**
- Say "no" to one thing you'd normally accept
- Say "yes" to something you want (without justifying)
- Notice: Does it hold? Or collapse under pressure?

## Connection to Theory

| Theory | Direction Connection |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Self-Determination Theory** | Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation |
| **Locus of Control** | Internal vs external attribution |
| **Approach-Avoidance** | Toward goals vs away from threats |

---

## Simple Application

**Career decision paralysis**: D=3.0, S=5.0, M=4.0  
**Pattern**: Every option feels like "should" (reactive)  
**Fix**: Stabilize S → then ask "What do I actually want?" (access autonomous D)
