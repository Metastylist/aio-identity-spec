# AIO Core Glossary

**AI-Oriented Identity Ontology (AIO)**  
Foundational specification for modeling identity as a dynamic system.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the **AIO Core Glossary** —  
a formal ontology defining identity as a dynamic, multi-layered system.

AIO provides a structured vocabulary for describing how identity forms, changes, stabilizes, and transitions over time.  
It is designed as a **reference layer** for AI systems, research frameworks, and applied identity modeling.

This is **not** a philosophical essay or a self-help framework.  
It is a **technical and conceptual specification**.

---

## Purpose

The AIO Core exists to:

- Define identity as a **field**, not a fixed entity  
- Formalize identity dynamics using system-level language  
- Enable AI systems to reason about identity, change, and intention  
- Provide a stable ontology for Metastyling-based tools and research  
- Serve as a reference layer for forecasting and modeling identity transitions

## What This Repository Contains

### 📘 `aio_core_glossary_v1.yaml`
The canonical source of truth.

Includes:
- Core identity primitives  
- DMES architecture  
- Levels of Awareness  
- Dynamics and transitions  
- Cost and resource modeling  
- Stability and noise concepts  
- Forecasting structures  
- Meta-quality metrics  

This file is intended to be:
- machine-readable  
- versioned  
- referenced by AI systems  
- used as an ontology layer  

---

## Conceptual Scope

The AIO Core defines:

- **Identity Field** — identity as a space of possible configurations  
- **Faces** — attractors within the field  
- **DMES** — Direction, Meaning, Expression, State  
- **Levels of Awareness (LoA)** — depth of observation and choice  
- **Transitions** — movement between identity states  
- **Cost & Resources** — economics of change  
- **Forecasting** — modeling probable and preferred futures  
- **Stability & Noise** — coherence and disturbance dynamics  

All higher-level systems (Metastyling, AI agents, forecasting tools)
build on top of this layer.
