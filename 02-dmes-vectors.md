# DMES Vectors: Four Dimensions of Identity Configuration

DMES provides the **coordinate system** for identity field—the "longitude and latitude" showing where you are right now.

---

## Q: What are DMES vectors?

**Definition**: **DMES** (Direction, Meaning, Expression, State) are **four entangled dimensions** that define any identity configuration at a given moment. They are not personality traits—they are **state variables** specifying current position in identity space.

**In one sentence**: DMES shows "where you are" in the identity field right now.

**Visual structure**:
```
    Direction (D)
         ↓
    Meaning (M) ← → Expression (E)
         ↓
     State (S)
```

**The four questions**:
- **D (Direction)**: WHY — Where is energy flowing?
- **M (Meaning)**: WHERE — Through what lens do I interpret?
- **E (Expression)**: WHAT — How am I showing up?
- **S (State)**: HOW — What is my nervous system baseline?

---

## Core Properties

### 1. Entanglement (Not Independence)

DMES vectors form **circular causality**, not linear chains:
```
D → M → E → S → D (continuous feedback loop)
```

**Change in one vector propagates through others.**

**Example cascade** (negative loop):
```
Trigger: Public criticism
S: 7.0 → 3.0 (nervous system destabilizes)
  ↓
M: 7.0 → 3.5 (interpretation locks: "This proves I'm inadequate")
  ↓
E: 7.0 → 2.5 (presence collapses—defensive or frozen)
  ↓
D: 7.0 → 2.0 (direction becomes reactive—prove worth, withdraw)
```

**Result**: System reconfigured from "Strategic Leader" Face to "Wounded Child" Face—not through choice, but through **vector cascade**.

### 2. Dual Axes (Semantic ↔ Environmental)

Each vector operates on **two axes**:

| Vector | Semantic Axis (Internal) | Environmental Axis (External) |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Direction** | Intention | Desire |
| **Meaning** | Story | Experience |
| **Expression** | Message | Style |
| **State** | Mindset | Emotions |

**Why this matters**: Same Direction can manifest differently—autonomous *intention* (semantic) vs. context-shaped *desire* (environmental).

### 3. Continuous Scale (0-10)

Values range **0-10** (individually calibrated):
- **High (8-10)**: Optimal functioning
- **Mid (4-7)**: Moderate, functional
- **Low (0-3)**: Dysregulated, collapsed, locked

**Important**: Scales are **relative to individual baseline**, not universal standards.

### 4. Context-Dependent

Same person exhibits different DMES values across contexts:
- D=8.5 (creative work), D=3.0 (family conflict)
- S=8.0 (calm environment), S=2.0 (public scrutiny)

**This is not inconsistency—it's evidence that DMES are configurations, not fixed traits.**

## The Four Vectors (Brief)

### Direction (D): Motivational Orientation

**Question**: WHY — Where is attention/energy flowing?

**High D (8-10)**: Autonomous, internally driven  
**Low D (0-3)**: Reactive, validation-dependent

**Example**:
- D=9: "Building this because it matters to me"
- D=2: "Doing this to prove something or meet expectations"

**→ Details**: [Direction Vector](./02-direction-vector.md) *(to be created)*

---

### Meaning (M): Interpretive Framework

**Question**: WHERE — Through what lens do I interpret?

**High M (8-10)**: Fluid, multiple perspectives  
**Low M (0-3)**: Locked into single interpretation (threat/victimhood)

**Example**:
- M=8: "This setback could mean failure, data, or approaching breakthrough"
- M=3: "This proves I'm not good enough" (only interpretation)

**→ Details**: [Meaning Vector](./02-meaning-vector.md) *(to be created)*

---

### Expression (E): Outward Manifestation

**Question**: WHAT — How am I showing up?

**High E (8-10)**: Congruent, internal state matches external signal  
**Low E (0-3)**: Incongruent, collapsed, or over-controlled performance

**Example**:
- E=8: Internal calm → calm presence
- E=3: Internal panic → frozen or frantic over-performance

**→ Details**: [Expression Vector](./02-expression-vector.md) *(to be created)*

---

### State (S): Nervous System Regulation

**Question**: HOW — What is my physiological baseline?

**High S (8-10)**: Regulated under pressure  
**Low S (0-3)**: Dysregulated, small triggers → large swings

**Example**:
- S=8: High-stakes meeting → elevated but manageable
- S=2: High-stakes meeting → panic attack, thought fragmentation

**Critical**: **When S drops below ~4.0, entire DMES system reorganizes.** This is autonomic response, not weakness.

## Practical Application: DMES Diagnosis

### Instead of: "I feel stuck" (vague)

### Use DMES mapping:
```
Current configuration:
D: 4.0 (unclear direction, some reactivity)
M: 3.0 (threat-focused interpretation) ← PRIMARY ISSUE
E: 6.0 (functional but strained)
S: 5.0 (moderate anxiety) ← MONITOR

Intervention target: M (reframe threat narratives)
Foundation support: S (prevent collapse below 4.0)
```

**Navigation strategy**:
1. Address **M** first (cognitive reframe, narrative work)
2. Support **S** simultaneously (prevent destabilization)
3. **D** and **E** will shift naturally as M stabilizes

## Connection to Existing Theory

| Theory Domain | DMES Connection |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Control Theory** | Feedback loops (circular causality) |
| **Polyvagal Theory** | State regulation (S vector) |
| **Narrative Psychology** | Meaning-making (M vector) |
| **Self-Determination** | Autonomous vs. controlled motivation (D vector) |
| **Embodied Cognition** | Body-mind coupling (E ↔ S feedback) |

---

## Mathematical Representation

DMES as state vector:

$$x(t) = \begin{bmatrix} D(t) \\ M(t) \\ E(t) \\ S(t) \end{bmatrix}$$

**Identity as weighted ensemble of Faces** (each Face = stable DMES configuration):

$$x(t) = \sum_{k} w_k(t) \cdot x^*_k$$

where $x^*_k$ = DMES signature of Face $k$

**Full dynamics**: See [Master Equation](../formulas/master-equation.md) *(to be created)*

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Sequential Intervention (Not Simultaneous)

**Attempting to shift all four vectors at once destabilizes coherence.**

**Strategy**: 
- Identify lowest/most misaligned vector
- Target that first
- Wait for cascade effects
- Then address next if needed

### 2. State is Foundation

**If S is unstable, no cognitive work (M) or strategic planning (D) will hold.**

When S < 4.0:
- D becomes reactive (fight-flight-freeze overrides intention)
- M locks into threat
- E collapses or over-controls

**Address S first** through somatic interventions (breathwork, movement, therapy).

### 3. Forecasting Enabled

Given current DMES + trajectory history → model probable futures:

$$P(x(t+\Delta t) \mid \text{DMES}_{\text{current}}, \text{history}, \text{context})$$
